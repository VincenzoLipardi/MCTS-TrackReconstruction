# MCTS for Quantum Ansatz Search in Particle Reconstruction

## Overview

This repository presents an innovative approach that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with variational quantum algorithms for solving the Particle Reconstruction problem. In this framework, MCTS serves as a powerful heuristic search strategy to explore the space of quantum ansatz configurations, enabling efficient and effective solutions to the Particle Reconstruction problem within a variational quantum computing paradigm.

## Key Concepts

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: MCTS is employed as a search strategy to navigate the space of quantum ansatz configurations. By iteratively building and exploring a search tree, MCTS guides the selection of promising ansatz configurations for further evaluation.

- **Variational Quantum Algorithms**: Particle Reconstruction is encoded as a variational quantum optimization problem, where the goal is to find the optimal parameters for a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) that minimizes a cost function representing the reconstruction quality.

- **Quantum Ansatz**: A parameterized quantum circuit is chosen as the ansatz, with the parameters representing the degrees of freedom to be optimized. MCTS efficiently explores the space of these parameters to find configurations that yield accurate reconstructions.
